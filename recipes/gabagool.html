            <p><strong>Gabagool:</strong> Much like Milk Steak this is a decadent meal that's layered with so much complexity that no human can grasp the full extent of its itricate tast in one life time... But one should always TRY! You may be wondering "But Sir, is it not simply Gaba?"... There are no dumb questions but this would bring my blood to a boil. Do not speak on the subjet if you have never seen the light. It is not simply Gaba... It is Gabagool.</p>

            <li>Get some spaghetti</li>
